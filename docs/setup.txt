create a react app (using vite : npm create vite@latest)
select your framework and setups

This will create a react js app

next : install tailwind css 
    ==> see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

run the app     
    ==> npm run dev

you can use tailwind css in the app now

next : install tanstack router (famous for ... )
    ==> see https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start
        npm install @tanstack/react-router
        npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin @tanstack/react-router-devtools
add tanstackrouter in the vite plugin
    export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [
            tailwindcss(),
            tanstackRouter(),
            react()
        ],
    })

create a routes folder inside src folder
add a __root.tsx file there
    ==> you will see that the file has content automatically

go to App.tsx file
-modify it as:-
    import {RouterProvider, createRouter} from '@tanstack/react-router';
    import {routeTree} from "./routeTree.gen.ts";
    import "./App.css";

    const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

    function App() {
        return (
            <RouterProvider router={router} />
        );
    }

    export default App;

go to __root.tsx file
you will see
function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div>Hello "__root"!</div>
      <Outlet />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

Outlet => route page (/ or /about or /contact)
<div>Hello "__root"!</div> => this will be visible on every page

create index.tsx page inside the routes folder ==> this will be / page

can simply ask AI to create a portfolio page content using tailwind css for the following details:
 <give your details>

Note: if you want. additoinal pages in your app,
create about.tsx or about/index.tsx inside the routes folder ==> this will be /about page

React app with tailwind css and tanstack router is setup

next: add a header

create src/components/header/Header.tsx

modify your RootComponent to:
function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div className="">
        <Header />
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

if you have multiple pages,
you might need this configuration as well, else you might see 404 when directly navigating to 
<your_website>/*
create a vercel.json file and then put this
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}

your app is now ready to be published

create a repo in github and push the code changes to github

now for the deployment part
-------------------------------
deploy in vercel
-------------------------------
create a vercel account
connect your github to your  vercel account
select your repo
build

connect to your domain:
project settings > domains
add your domain (your domainname.com.np)
copy the vercel DNS
go to your domain dashboard page in mercantile  - click edit dns on your active domain tab > edit dns
Update your primay nameservers with the vercel dns (for both primary and secondary)
it will take some time to reflect the changes 
you are all good 

Congratulations! you have your own website ready now

If you make any changes in your code and push it to github, the vercel will auto build and deploy it
if the changes are not reflected, look for logs in the deployment tab of vercel > you application
