Domain = WHAT, Application = WHEN/WHAT SEQUENCE, Infrastructure = HOW.

Infrastructure is all the TOOLS and SERVICES you use to run the business:
The HOW you do things
Replaceable/swappable
Infrastructure is EVERYTHING that answers "HOW":
How we store data? (Database)

How we run code? (Cloud/Server)

How we communicate? (Email/SMS/APIs)

How we monitor? (Logging/Alerting)

How we deploy? (CI/CD)

Infrastructure = Tools
Infrastructure = IMPLEMENTS INTERFACES
infrastructure classes are replacable

Application Layer: "What to do" (not "How to do it")
Application layer cares only about the logic of what the application should achieve, 
not the technical details of how it achieves it.

Application = BUSINESS WORKFLOWS
Application = Blueprint Steps 







I was learning about Clean Architecture in .NET and wanted to share a few simple takeaways.
The name might sound intimidating at first, but at its core, it’s really just about separation of concerns.

Clean Architecture focuses on grouping files and folders into clear layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility and a few simple rules.

<image>

As shown in the diagram, there are four main layers:

Presentation

Infrastructure

Application

Domain

The key rule is that dependencies flow inward:
Presentation → Application → Domain

This means, in a typical request flow, a request first reaches the Presentation layer (API endpoint or controller).
The controller then calls a service in the Application layer, which in turn interacts with the Domain logic.
Interfaces are usually defined in the Application layer, while their implementations live either in:

the Application layer (if it’s pure business logic), or

the Infrastructure layer (if it involves tools like databases, email, or external services).

For example, repository implementations (IRepository) usually belong to the Infrastructure project.

Why do this?

Each layer is clearly separated and can usually be worked on independently

The Domain layer stays clean, technology-agnostic, and free from external dependencies

The Application layer defines what needs to happen, while the Infrastructure layer defines how it happens

The Presentation layer focuses mainly on API endpoints, controllers, and middleware

One of the biggest advantages is how easy it becomes to change tools:

Switching from SQL Server to PostgreSQL only affects the Infrastructure layer

Switching from REST APIs to gRPC mainly affects the Presentation layer only

Each layer can be tested more easily in isolation

Will I always use Clean Architecture?

Not necessarily. I guess architecture is about choosing the right trade-offs based on our project’s needs.
For smaller or simpler applications, merging the Application and Domain layers can be a perfectly reasonable and practical choice.

Clean Architecture is not a rulebook—it’s a guideline. We should use what makes sense for our project.


Ease of Technology Changes: For instance, switching from SQL Server to PostgreSQL requires updates only in the Infrastructure layer

Flexibility in Interfaces: Transitioning from REST to gRPC does not affect core business rules

Simplified Testing: Unit tests can focus on business logic without relying on databases or APIs

It is worth noting that architecture should be adapted to project needs. For smaller applications or tight deadlines, merging the Application and Domain layers is often a practical approach. Architecture is ultimately about making trade-offs that best suit your project requirements.

Clean Architecture is not just about clean code—it is about building robust, maintainable, and evolvable systems.
