Creating a New Application: Which Architecture Should You Choose?
Monolith? Modular Monolith ? or the fancy Microservices


Microservices are everywhere.
But here’s the truth:
Microservices are like Ferraris: Everyone wants one, but most people are just driving to the grocery store. They are a platform concern, not a feature.

So before choosing them, ask yourself — do you actually need them?

Start by asking these questions:

What are the core modules of the application?

How are those modules related to each other?

What kind of load does each module have?

Do some modules scale differently than others?

Do any modules have different security or deployment needs?

Only after answering these should you decide the architecture.

What you can do:

Start simple.

Add modularity early.

Split into microservices only when real, proven pain appears.

 Stop Over-Engineering: The Grocery Store Guide to Architecture 🍎
Choosing an architecture is a platform concern, not a feature. You can sell an apple using any of these three, but the "cost of the building" is what changes.

1. The Monolith (The Solo Shop)
The Scene: You do it all. You're the cashier, the cleaner, and the accountant.

The Technical Reality: One project, one database. Simple.

The Catch: If you get sick, the shop closes. If 50 people walk in, you panic.

Verdict: Great for starting. Don't build a stadium for a 1-man show.

2. The Modular Monolith (The Department Store)
The Scene: One big building, but you’ve got "zones." A Bakery desk, a Meat counter, and a separate Checkout.

The Technical Reality: Different projects in one solution. They can talk to each other easily because they are under one roof.

The Catch: You still share one electric grid and one plumbing system (The Database).

Verdict: The Sweet Spot. It keeps your code clean without the "Microservice Tax."

3. Microservices (The Separate Factory)
The Scene: Your Bakery is so busy it needs its own industrial oven and a dedicated power line. So, you move the Bakery to a separate building across town.

The Technical Reality: The Bakery is now its own app with its own database. It sends bread to the main store via a truck (The Network).

The Catch: If the truck gets stuck in traffic (Network Lag), the store has no bread. It’s expensive and complex to manage.

Verdict: Only do this for the parts of your app that are "exploding" and need their own "power grid."

The Moral of the Story
You don’t need a Ferrari to go to the grocery store two blocks away.

Microservices are an optimization, not a starting point.

Most apps fail because they were so "future-proof" they required 10 DevOps engineers just to open the front door.

Rule of thumb: Start with a Modular Monolith. It keeps your "departments" organized from day one. If your Bakery ever gets too big for the building, you can ship it off to its own factory later.
